## About the Game

Take on the role of a new high school student who interacts with a cast
of characters, including classmates and teachers. What happens to your
character after high school is up to you: Every choice impacts the future! 

The STEM Career Paths Game is a character-driven game designed for middle-school
and early high-school players. It can be played alone or with friends.

## For Teachers

There are many ways to use _The STEM Career Paths Game_! You can play on mobile, tablets,
laptops, and deskop computers&mdash;we support anything with a browser, including touch or
mouse input.

- Students can play it as a single-player game on their own
- Students can play in small groups, discussing their goals and making decisions together
- You can play it as part of a larger lesson on STEM careers

The game is played entirely in the browser. Make sure your IT system has whitelisted the
game's domain so that it will load on your school's network.

The prerelease version of the game available now does not support iOS devices. We are hoping
to fix this by the end of April 2024.
