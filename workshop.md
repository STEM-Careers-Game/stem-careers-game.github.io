# Workshop

Our team developed a way to use _The STEM Career Paths Game_
as part of a workshop on STEM careers. 
The assumption is that the people running the workshop are themselves
STEM professionals of some kind.
Although _The STEM Career Paths Game_ is playable as a single-player experience,
the workshop has the students work together in groups to foster discussion.

## Outline

1. Introduce yourselves by explaining the path you took into a STEM career. No two paths are the same!

1. Ask the audience to define "STEM," instructing them if they do not know.

1. Circulate paper and ask participants to take a few minutes to write down jobs or fields that they consider to be STEM. (2-3 minutes)
 Optionally put them into groups to share their answers. 

1. As a next step, ask the students to classify the jobs they listed as S, T, E, or M, or as combinations of these.
Again, they can be put into small groups for brief discussion here as well.

1. The previous two steps prime the students to enage with the game. Get the students into small groups
and play through the game to the end at least  twice. This can take about 10 minutes.

1. After playing the game, get the students into groups to talk about their experience. 

1. If time allows, ask the students to try writing their own stories that could be explored in a game like this.
